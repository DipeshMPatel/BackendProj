While connecting with db keep these 2 things in mind (Good Practices)
1) while connecting you CAN face problem hence write the code in 'try catch block' or 'promises' in a way that you can handle any errors 
2) "db is in another continent" - Talking (communicating) with db takes time. So you will have to apply 'async await'

import mongoose, {Schema} from "mongoose";

const userSchema = new Schema({})

export const User = 
mongoose.model("User", userSchema)  // Here in in Mongo db "User" will be stored as "users" (lowercase and in plural)
                                    // also mongodb is intelligent enough that if you give "Categories", it will be stored as "categories", 
                                    // However while writing it in the code we generally write singular form only
