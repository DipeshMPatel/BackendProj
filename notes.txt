While connecting with db keep these 2 things in mind (Good Practices)
1) while connecting you CAN face problem hence write the code in 'try catch block' or 'promises' in a way that you can handle any errors 
2) "db is in another continent" - Talking (communicating) with db takes time. So you will have to apply 'async await' 



app.use(cors())             we use the word app."use" generally when we are doing middleware or cofiguration settings
